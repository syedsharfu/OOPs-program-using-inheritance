    "The Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class (derived or child class) based on an existing class (base or parent class). It allows you to reuse the attributes and methods of the base class and extend or override them in the derived class.\n",
    "In Python, a class can inherit from one or more base classes, creating a hierarchy of classes. This is known as multiple inheritance.\n",
    "In Python, inheritance is implemented using the class keyword, and a derived class is defined by specifying the base class inside parentheses. \n",
    "For example: \n",

    "Single Inheritance: Single inheritance is a concept where a class inherits from only one base class. Single Inheritance has a single parent class.\n",

    "Simplicity: Single inheritance is conceptually simpler and easier to understand. It enforces a clear hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "Avoiding Ambiguity: There is no ambiguity in method or attribute resolution, as there is only one parent class.\n",
    "Single Inheritance promotes a simpler and more structured class hierarchy, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",

    "Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance is a concept where a class can inherit from more than one base class. This means that a derived class can have multiple parent classes.\n",

    "Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows you to inherit and combine functionality from multiple sources, promoting code reuse.\n",

    "Differences:\n",
    "Number of Base Classes: The most obvious difference is that single inheritance allows a class to inherit from a single base class, while multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes.\n",
